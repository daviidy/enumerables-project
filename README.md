# enumerables-project_test_case
This project is the seventh one in Ruby module at Microverse. In this project, we created custom test cases for enumerables methods for the following:
- #my_each
- #my_each_with_index
- #select
- #my_all?
- #my_any?
- #my_none?
- #my_count
- #my_map
- #my_inject
- #multiply_els
